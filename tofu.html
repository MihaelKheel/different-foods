        <p class="desc">Tofu, also known as bean curd, is a versatile and popular soybean-based food product. It is made by coagulating soy milk and then pressing it into solid blocks or various textures, ranging from soft to extra-firm. Tofu has a neutral flavor, making it suitable for a wide range of culinary applications. It is a common source of plant-based protein and is often used as a meat substitute in vegetarian and vegan diets. Tofu is known for its high protein content, low saturated fat, and its ability to absorb the flavors of the dishes it's prepared with, making it a staple in many Asian and international cuisines.</p>
