        <p class="desc">Mango Graham is a popular Filipino dessert or no-bake cake made from layers of graham crackers, sweet mango slices, and a creamy mixture typically made from condensed milk and all-purpose cream. The layers are assembled in a baking dish, chilled in the refrigerator, and left to set for a few hours. It's a simple and delicious dessert that combines the sweetness of ripe mangoes with the creaminess of the filling and the crunch of graham crackers. Mango Graham is a favorite summer treat in the Philippines and is enjoyed by people of all ages.</p>
