        <p class="desc">Takoyaki is a popular Japanese street food known for its savory, round-shaped snacks. These delectable balls are made from a batter typically containing wheat flour and dashi (a fish and seaweed-based stock), filled with small pieces of tender octopus, pickled ginger, and green onions. They are cooked in a special molded pan, creating a crispy outer layer and a soft, molten interior. Takoyaki is often drizzled with a sweet and savory sauce, mayonnaise, and sprinkled with bonito flakes and seaweed flakes, offering a delightful combination of flavors and textures.</p>
