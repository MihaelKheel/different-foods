        <p class="desc">Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that typically consists of vinegared rice, known as "shari" or "sumeshi," combined with various ingredients such as fresh fish, vegetables, and sometimes tropical fruits. These ingredients are often rolled into a cylindrical shape using a sheet of seaweed, known as "nori," or served as small, bite-sized pieces. Sushi can be enjoyed with condiments like soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger, and it is known for its delicate balance of flavors, textures, and presentation. Sushi is not only a delicious culinary experience but also an art form in its preparation and presentation.</p>
